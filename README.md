# Reinforcement Learning Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my projects in reinforcement learning. This portfolio highlights my exploration and implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms to solve diverse problems.

# Project 1: Parking Space Optimization

- Finding the optimal parking space near a restaurant to minimize the total time required to reach the destination.
- As you approach each parking space, you determine whether it is full or empty based on a probabilistic model.
- The time to drive past each space is 2 seconds, and the time to walk past each space is 8 seconds.
- If no parking space is available, you must drive to a special lot, adding 30 seconds to your trip.
- Technologies Used: Python - NumPy, Reinforcement Learning

# Project 2: Racetrack Problem with Q-Learning and SARSA

- Solve a simplified racetrack problem using Q-learning and SARSA algorithms.
- The car navigates through a discrete grid of positions with discrete velocities.
- Rewards are given for staying on the track (-1) or trying to drive off the track (-5).
- The episode ends when the car crosses the finish line or after 200 steps.
- Technologies Used: Python - NumPy, Reinforcement Learning
